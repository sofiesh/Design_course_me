=======================

This report will analyze the load time for 3 different websites and what improvements are possible 
with regards to load time and usability.


Selection
-----------------------

I decided to use the same websites as I had for the color analysis.


Method
-----------------------

I first used <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">Pagespeed Insights</a> to analyze availability, best practice, performance and SEO. Then I checked loadspeed, loaded resources and the size of each website using DevTools.


Result
-----------------------

This is the result of the study:

This site has a lot of content and images. It stands out of the three with how much improvement could be seen by sending images in modern format and to postpone reading of images that are not shown.

This page also has quite a few chapters and a lot of images. Out of the three sites it is the largest one. Image formats could be reviewed and modernized, plugins to read the most relevant parts first could be implemented.

First response time is quite high in relation to the total size of the site. Trying an optimization plugin or upgrade the server might improve the performance.

Analysis
-----------------------

The size of the three sites differ greatly. Still it seems that they can benefit from similar measures such as modernize image format, remove unnecessary CSS and use plugins to read the most relevant content first.

It would be interesting to check if most user engagement is via desktop or mobile. I think it could be argued that this segment should be better optimized for mobile than what these 3 sites are since more and more content is consumed using mobile devices.

The winner of this test is Underbara Clara. The website is relatively large with regards to load time. It is also performing better than the others on mobile.

When it comes to perceiving a website being fast or slow I think it matters what type of website it is. For example I have much less patience for long load time when it comes to financial transactions. So I would say that travel- or e-com sites must be much faster than the sites I've analyzed here. For this type of website I think 2-3 seconds can be ok.
