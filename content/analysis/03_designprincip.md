Design Principles
=======================

This report is about making the website visually compelling and what design principles are used to do that. I will start by analyzing 3 websites and then also make a similar analysis of my own site.

Selection
-----------------------

I have chosen to analyze the same websites that I've used for the two previous assignments. I think it will be interesting to review the same sites from different perspectives.
<a href="https://teknifik.se/">Teknifik</a>
<a href="https://underbaraclaras.se/">Underbara Clara</a>
<a href="https://juliak.se/">Julia Khouri</a>


Method
-----------------------

The analysis of website design will be done primarily trying to identify some of the 20 design principles as described by Canva (https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/).

The study will answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of the site? Why and for whom does it exist?
2. What are the overall characteristics of the site design?
3. Does the design support the aim/purpose? Does it give the right feeling?
4. What design principles can be seen? (examples)
5. Are the design principles the same or different for the front page and the sub-pages?

When analyzing my own site I will answer point 2-5.

1. What is the purpose of the site? Why and for whom does it exist?
This is the home of a tech-blog. It also has a webshop, courses, podcast, games etc. The overall purpose of the site is to help more people discover technology and the possibilities of the digital world, as well as learning about tools to convert ideas to reality.

2. What are the overall characteristics of the site design?
The site is created mainly in blue, turquoise and purple. The header has lines and shapes and there is a lot of movement created. 

3. Does the design support the aim/purpose? Does it give the right feeling?
I think that the right feeling is created. The different shades of blue accompanied with some adjacent colors signal intelligence and it is very easy to find your way around.

4. What design principles can be seen? (examples)

    1. Lines are used in the header image creating movement.
    2. Colors are re-used from the header creating sections with articles or highlighting parts of the page.
    7. Grid is made to create a section for articles/pages on workshops, lectures, podcasts.
    11. Contrast is used for some sub-pages where a section in dark purple breaks the page that is otherwise white. For this section the text is white.

5. Are the design principles the same or different for the front page and the sub-pages?
Mostly the design principles are the same. The header is used on all pages and the purple contrasting section exists on several of the subpages.

1. What is the purpose of the site? Why and for whom does it exist?
This is one of Swedens largest blog by a woman named Clara. She shares her thoughts on life, gardening, food, family life and more with her many readers. 

2. What are the overall characteristics of the site design?
The background is a white wooden panel wall. On top of it is a drawing that looks to be from Claras house, there's a window, table and Clara sitting next to it.

3. Does the design support the aim/purpose? Does it give the right feeling?
I think the design suits the purpose and the feeling of the page. It feels artsy and homely and very welcoming. 

4. What design principles can be seen? (examples)

    8. Texture is created by the wodden panel wall used as the background.
    11. Contrasting colors red and green are used for different parts of the page. E.g. comment section and pictures from instagram are in red.  
    13. Grid is used for the recipe subpage, showing between 2-4 images/boxes depending on screen width.
    17. Movement is created in the header. Since it is winter there is snow falling outside the window and a candle is lit - its flame moving slowly.

5. Are the design principles the same or different for the front page and the sub-pages?
The principles are the same for the front page and sub-pages except that grid is only used for the recipe page.

1. What is the purpose of the site? Why and for whom does it exist?
This is a smaller blog by a woman named Julia who shares her dreams, thoughts, some recipes, and her everyday life.

2. What are the overall characteristics of the site design?
The design is very minimalistic, only using 2 pastel colors, a shade of brown and white. Instead its the photos that are given space.

3. Does the design support the aim/purpose? Does it give the right feeling?
I think it gives the feel that Julia is looking for, and it really puts focus on all the photos.

4. What design principles can be seen? (examples)
I cant really think of any design principles that are used for the website design. Sure, there are colors and typography but nothing stands out. Instead she has a lot of it in her photos. She has close-ups of rocks, wooden floor, dried flowers hanging on a cupboard. 

5. Are the design principles the same or different for the front page and the sub-pages?
Both the front page and the very few subpages are the same.

My own website
2. What are the overall characteristics of the site design?
Blue/grey with a purple unicorn.

3. Does the design support the aim/purpose? Does it give the right feeling?
I do think it gives a playful feeling and it reminds me of the ocean giving me a happy feeling when I look at it.

4. What design principles can be seen? (examples)
    14. Randomness can be seen with the little unicorn. 
    19. Typography, Amatic SC, that is adding to the playfulness.

5. Are the design principles the same or different for the front page and the sub-pages?
The principles are the same for all the pages.

Analysis
-----------------------

I was a little surprised not being able to identify more of the design principles. Before I started the course I was under the impression that some of Swedens largest blogs would have thought alot about this. But I think many content creators focus a lot on the pictures.
However, I have felt more drawn to the sites where more principles have been used so perhaps there can be something to gain from considering it more. 

When it comes to my own website I think I should implement a couple more of the design principles to make it a little more interesting.

I like elements with texture so I decided to add that to my header. I also thought it would be fun to add some movement for my little unicorn. When I had done that I also started to think that the background color needed to have a greater contrast compared to the header/footer. When I went from the darker green/blue to the lighter one the picture on index.md melted together with the background too much so I decided to add a frame using the same color as the header.
So what I added was: texture, movement and frame. I didnt add frames to the gallery because I wanted to keep a simpler design on that. At first I was also thinking about adding shadows and working with grid and hierarchy but I felt that there's too little content on each of the pages at this point. I might come back to that later.
