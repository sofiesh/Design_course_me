Color perspectives
=======================

This week we're looking at how colors and typography are used on 3
webpages. What does the color palette look like and what feeling 
do I think that the creator is trying to build.
<br>
<br>

Selection
-----------------------

I googled to find blogs that are active in 2022. The second hit was a girl that listed 36 blogs to follow. When selecting 3 out of the 36 I 
first removed all those that were on larger platforms like motherhood.se and elle.se because those have less room for personlization. Then I
looked at the rest of them, several had a very basic layout with white
background color, black fonts and some images, so I selected 3 that were a little bit more different from each other. These are the 3 webpages we will look at:

<a href="https://teknifik.se/">Teknifik</a>

<a href="https://underbaraclaras.se/">Underbara Clara</a>

<a href="https://juliak.se/">Julia Khouri</a>
<br>
<br>

Method
-----------------------

To analyze the webpages I'm reviewing by going through the following steps:
1. Eyedropper color picker -> map palette
2. Inspect tool -> Typography
3. Compare with literature, what feeling is aimed for?
    What color scheme was used? Are the colors warm or cold? What do the colors mean?
<br>
<br>

Fonts: Open Sans, Montserrat

Feeling: Using an adjacent color scheme with variants of blue and green. Purple is used to highlight some passages, for icons and some chapters. I think blue is used to symbolize intelligence and purple makes it playful and a little more feminine. The font feels simple and makes it easy to read.
The webpage is about explaining tech for everyone and I think the mix of colors supports that.
I think that the colors and fonts give the page the profile that the author is looking for.

Fonts: The Soul of Vodka, Libre Baskerville, Sans-serif
Bold, elegant, modern

Feeling: The header color is green, it gives a feeling of closeness to nature and it is close to warm. When accentuated with mustard yellow sub-headings and a cherry red "reader comment" indicator it signals warmth. The webpage is inviting the reader into the home and personal life.
I think that the colors and fonts give exactly the profile that the author is looking for.

</table>

Fonts: Baskerville, 

Feeling: This webpage uses light colors, a cold bluey-grey for the header, a cool beige for the footer and white for the main content area where mostly photos are published. This is accompanied with a serif type brown font - Baskerville.
I do think the colors and font create the feeling that the author is looking for but I also think an accent color to create more engagement is missing making it a little boring.

Analysis
-----------------------

The Teknifik blog uses many different colors, however they are adjacent colors and also in some cases shades of the same color. It gives a lot of movement to the page which works well especially since it has fewer photos in each post/article compare to the other two blogs. 
Underbara Clara brings in accent colors which brings attention to comment sections and other articles that she has published previously. In addition there is a "categories" tab in the nav bar with funny icons that have a lot of color. All the colors draw attention and you feel like there is a lot to discover. The Julia K page is the most calm and minimalist. You are not drawn to different articles, just scrolling top-bottom.

The conclusion is that you really can do a lot with colors and icons in terms of guiding the reader and making them interact with the page. If you want e.g. more comments it could be good to highlight that section with a color that makes it stand out.
