About the site
==========================

Basic structure
---------------------
<p>This webpage is built on a PHP framework called Pico. It enables me to add pages written in Markdown and build layout using Twig, which is sort of an HTML extension.</p>

Themes and typograhpy
---------------------
<p>The theme for the site is created using SASS, a CSS preprocessor.</p>
<p>I've tried out different fonts that I like. At this point I'm not sure which ones I'll continue going forward but I like Oswald and Amatic SC because they feel a bit playful.</p>

Responsivity
---------------------
<p>At the moment the site doesnt contain that many features so the main thing is that I've tried to ensure that the image(-s) will not force the visitor to scroll horizontally. I'm also using mobile-menu.css and Normalize.css to adapt to different devices and browsers.</p>


Header 2
---------------------
<p>Paragraph</p>
