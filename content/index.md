About me
==========================

<p>I'm Sofie, a mother and a wife to those I love the most. I'm an industrial engineer who also studied product development and design some years ago in the far north of Sweden. Since I graduated in 2014 I've worked for a large industrial manufacturing company, doing ALL sorts of things e.g. sales rep, manufacturing and logistics process design and development, project manager, product owner.</p>


So why am I here now
---------------------
<p>During the pandemic I started thinking more about what I really enjoy doing and what I want to be doing in the future. Then I found this course package that sounded really interesting. Almost everything has been new so far so I've learnt a ton, now I'm really looking forward to learn more about design.</p>
